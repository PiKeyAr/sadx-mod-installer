# SADX Mod Installer contributions and derivative works

There is no license for SADX Mod Installer, and I cannot prevent anyone from doing whatever they want with its source code and assets. Therefore, the guidelines below are merely a request for cooperation that I put out in good faith that people will follow them.

## Using SADX Mod Installer code in your own projects

* If you want to make another installer for SADX based on the code from this repository, please consider making a pull request instead.
* If you would like to make a similar installer for another game, please create your own fork. Credit is appreciated.
* Please do not use the code on this repo to create malware or fake/scam installers.

## Contributing to SADX Mod Installer
I accept the following contributions:
* Translations, as well as revisions and corrections to existing translations (see below)
* Code optimizations/coding style updates (as long as they are consistent with the rest of the project)
* New functionality of any kind except new mods

At the moment I'm not looking to add new mods to the installer.

## Translating SADX Mod Installer
You can contribute a translation by sending me the following files translated in your language:
* License file (English version: [`lang\license\License_EN.rtf`](https://github.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/blob/master/lang/license/License_EN.rtf))
* NSIS language file (English version: [`lang\English.nlf`](https://github.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/blob/master/lang/English.nlf))
* NSIS header file (English version: [`lang\English.nsh`](https://github.com/PiKeyAr/sadx-mod-installer/blob/master/lang/English.nsh))

I also really appreciate updates to existing translations. The installer may receive updates that add more strings, which will remain untranslated unless the translation is updated to match the new version.

Thank you for your help.
